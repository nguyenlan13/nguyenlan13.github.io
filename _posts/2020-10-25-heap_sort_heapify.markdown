A heap sorting algorithm utilizes a binary heap data structure. A binary tree is a data structure that allows each parent node to have a maimum of two children elements, a left and right child. Heaps are binary trees with some additional rules; heaps must follow a specific order where the binary tree is filled up from left to right and it must be a min or max heap. Max heaps require that each parent node is greater or equal to the value of its childen nodes.
