The react component lifecycle consists of three phases, creation (mounting), updating, and deletion(unmounting). To control how a component responds to a change, we can use lifecycle methods. During the mounting phase, there are two methods available for use: getDerivedStateFromProps, which would be called right before the render method, and componentDidMount, which would be called right after the render method.
