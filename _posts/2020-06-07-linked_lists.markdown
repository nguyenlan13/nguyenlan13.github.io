A linked list is a linear and dynamic data structure, meaning there is order like an array but it is dynamic in that its memory allocation is not fixed; it can grow or shrink. Linked lists (singly-linked) consists of a head node that has a pointer that points (reference to) to subsequent nodes and ends with a tail node that points to null. 

Linked lists can be one solution to collisions in hash tables and also solve the memory allocation issues often seen in arrays.
