This application was built utilizing a Ruby on Rails backend with session cookies for API authentication and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.

# E-Commerce

This project was an e-commerce application for my small custom T-shirt business. This application was very challenging to build. Just implementing the authentication process took multiple days to figure out. The backend consists of multiple join tables to form the category, review, and wishlist functionality.
