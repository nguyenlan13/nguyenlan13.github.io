Graphs consist of nodes(vertices) and edges. Edges show us which nodes are connected and how they are connected. Graphs are used to help us in a variety of scenarios and applications. For instance, they can be useful in representing networks or in social media (or dating) applications to find the closest connections. Networks such as maps can use graphs to determine the shortest or fastest routes to a destination. In social media platforms, a node can represent a person; it would contain all of the personâ€™s data such as bio, age, name, profile picture and each connection to another person would be an edge.
