A VPN, or a virtual private network provides a secure connection to a network over the internet and it helps protect from our internet activity from prying eyes. Your VPN service connects your device to a remote server and allows you to mask your identity, making it appear as though your IP address is the one of the remote server.

It works by routing your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel, protecting your identity and location. This is quite useful when using a public Wi-Fi network to ensure that others are not intercepting your connection and collecting personal data. 

VPNs can also be used to access content from other countries, by bypassing the geopgraphic restrictions.
